# Laravel Database Encryption Package

[![MIT Licensed](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.md)

## Package to extend Eloquent with the capability to search in encrypted values

## Key Features

* Add custom validation rules for encrypted database columns
* Add searching capabilities for encrypted data using the following:
  `whereEncrypted`, `orWhereEncrypted` and `whereInEncrypted`
* Uses openssl for encrypting and decrypting fields

## Requirements

* Laravel: >= 10.0
* PHP: >= 8.2

## Schema Requirements

Encrypted values are usually longer than plain text values, sometimes much longer.
You may find that the column widths in your database tables need to be altered to
store the encrypted values generated by this package.

We highly recommend to alter your column types to `TEXT` or `LONGTEXT`

## Installation

### Step 1: Composer Source

Add the following to your "repositories" block in composer.json:

```
{
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/araszka/laravel-database-encryption.git"
}
```

### Step 2: Composer Require

Via Composer command line:

```bash
composer require elgibor-solution/laravel-database-encryption
```

## Usage

Use Laravels casting abilities to determine whether an attribute should be encrypted.

For example:

```php
use ESolution\DBEncryption\Traits\ExtendedEncryption;

class User extends Eloquent 
{
    use ExtendedEncryption;
   
    /**
     * The attributes that should be encrypted on save.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $casts = [
        'first_name' => 'encrypted', 
        'last_name' => 'encrypted'
    ];
}
```

### Searching Encrypted Fields Example:

Add the [ExtendedEncryption](src%2FTraits%2FExtendedEncryption.php) trait to any model you want to search encrypted values on.
Searching encrypted field can be done by calling the `whereEncrypted`, `orWhereEncrypted` or `whereInEncrypted` functions
similar to laravel eloquent `where`, `orWhere` and `whereIn`.

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\User;

class UsersController extends Controller 
{
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        return User::whereEncrypted('first_name','john')
                    ->orWhereEncrypted('last_name','!=','Doe')
                    ->get();
    }
}
```

### Exists and Unique Validation Rules

If you are using exists and unique rules with encrypted values replace it with exists_encrypted and unique_encrypted

```php      
$validator = validator(['email'=>'foo@bar.com'], ['email'=>'exists_encrypted:users,email']);
$validator = validator(['email'=>'foo@bar.com'], ['email'=>'unique_encrypted:users,email']);
```

## Frequently Asked Question

#### Can I search encrypted data?

YES! You will able to search on attributes which are encrypted by this package because.
If you need to search on data then use the `whereEncrypted` and `orWhereEncrypted` function:

```php
$user = User::whereEncrypted('email', 'test@gmail.com')
            ->orWhereEncrypted('email', 'test2@gmail.com')
            ->firstOrFail();
```

It will automatically added on the eloquent once the model uses `EncryptedAttribute`

#### Can I encrypt all my `User` model data?

Aside from IDs you can encrypt everything you wan't

For example:
Logging-in on encrypted email

```php
$user = User::whereEncrypted('email', 'test@gmail.com')
    ->where('active', true)
    ->get()
    ->filter(fn($user) => Hash::check(request()->get('password'), $user->password))
    ->first();
```
